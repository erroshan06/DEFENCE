<h2>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>A Frontend Developer is a professional who specializes in creating the user-facing part of a websiteâ€”everything a person sees and interacts with in their browser. They are the architects of the digital experience, responsible for turning a static design into a living, breathing, and interactive webpage.</p>
<p>Their primary job is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements, layouts, buttons, and animations that make a website functional and enjoyable to use. They bridge the gap between design and technology, ensuring the website not only looks good but is also responsive, accessible, and fast.</p>
